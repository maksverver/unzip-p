A nonexhaustive list of things I've changed:

  - External [patches](patches/README.md)
  - Added zipbomb detection (a5b558c)
  - Added simplified Makefile (4d6a7e9)
  - Automated tests (5118111)
  - zipgrep: change egrep to grep -E (f2fe7ce)
    (this prevents printing of deprecation warnings on Arch Linux)
