  Zip archive file size:                   1572392 (000000000017FE28h)
  Actual end-cent-dir record offset:       1572036 (000000000017FCC4h)
  Expected end-cent-dir record offset:     1572036 (000000000017FCC4h)
  (based on the length of the central directory and its expected offset)

  This zipfile constitutes the sole disk of a single-part archive; its
  central directory contains 420 entries.
  The central directory is 33649 (0000000000008371h) bytes long,
  and its (expected) offset in bytes from the beginning of the zipfile
  is 1538387 (0000000000177953h).
